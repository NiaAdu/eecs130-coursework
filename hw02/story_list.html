<a href="#"><h3>The Little Match Girl</h3></a>

  alt="The little match girl lighting a match">
<p>The Little Match Girl, also titled, The Little Matchstick Girl is one
  of our Favorite Fairy Tales. Published by Hans Christian Andersen in 1845,
  it exemplifies his broad literary talent and ability. I personally like to
  read this story at least twice a year, once in Autumn as the holiday season
  comes into focus, and then again around the Christmas holiday. It's a gentle
  reminder of the value of compassion and charity. </p>

<p>Goldilocks and the Three Bears was originally titled The Story of the Three Bears,
  published in the collection English Fairytales, retold by Flora Annie Steel (1922),
  illustrated by Arthur Rackham. We hope you think it's not too hot, not too cold,
  but JUST RIGHT! </p>

    alt="Chefs chasing after a gingerbread man who has come to life">
<p>Enjoy sharing The Gingerbread Man, alternately titled, The Little Gingerbread Man,
  with pictures and decorations by Robert Gaston Herbert, 1910. We've taken the liberty
  to add Gingerbread Man's taunting chant as he evades his captors throughout the story:
  "RUN, RUN, FAST AS YOU CAN. YOU CAN'T CATCH ME, I'M THE GINGERBREAD MAN!"  </p>

<a href="#"><h3>The Tortoise and the Hare</h3></a>
<img src="https://assets.americanliterature.com/al/images/story/aesops-fables/the-hare-and-the-tortoise.jpg"
      alt="A tortoise and a hare in a race">
<p>"The Tortoise and the Hare" is one of Aesop's Fables and is numbered 226 in the
  Perry Index. The account of a race between unequal partners has attracted
  conflicting interpretations. It is itself a variant of a common folktale theme
  in which ingenuity and trickery (rather than doggedness) are employed to overcome
  a stronger opponent. </p>
