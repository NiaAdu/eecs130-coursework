      <p>My name’s Nia its nice to meet you, thanks for coming and checking out my work! I am
        currently <br> a third-year journalism student at the Medill School of Journalism at
        Northwestern University. Entering into college I was <br> really excited about written
        journalism having worked on two magazines during high school. But over time at
        Medill and <br> through exploring various extracurriculars I have found a passion for
        digital media storytelling, my specialties being photo <br> and video. There’s something
        that feels so real and honest about photo and video that has made me stick with it.
        Post-<br> graduation I am hoping work either in documentary journalism or fashion photography,
        both of which you can find<br> examples of on my website. If you would like to check out my
        full resume click
